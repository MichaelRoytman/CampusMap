# CampusMap
## Brandeis Campus Map

Map.c contains implementations of a graph adjacency list data structure and a min. heap data structure, which are used in implementations of Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm.

Tour.h contains implementation of Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm to find the MST for a tour of Brandeis's campus.

Map.h, MapNew.c, MapInput.h, MapOutput.h, MapPATH.h, MapData.h, MapDataEdges.txt, and MapDataVertices.txt are all either supporting files or necessary data.
